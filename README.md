# Python-Port-Forwarding
Simple project to implement port forwarding with Python3.  The purpose of this project is for setup port quickly and easily.  This is helpful if you're like me and forget the Chisel syntax or ssh tunneling syntax.  This also helps in situations in which you're having trouble compiling for the target.
